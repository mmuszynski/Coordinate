Coordinate

A basic coordinate system for integer-based coordinates for use with Swift.

Example:
let zero = Coordinate(x: 0, y: 0)
let oneOne = Coordinate(row: 1, col: 1)

Created for use with Advent of Code 2023. Useful in a lot of grid situations. Probably more useful if more generalized, but here it is.
